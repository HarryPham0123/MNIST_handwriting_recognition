# MNIST_handwriting_recognition
Using MNIST handwriting images dataset to train neural network handwriting recognition model 
- "data.zip" contains both training data and test data for training model and compute the performance of model
- "data_my_model.zip" contains some particular random handwriten images which is used to check the model optionally

28\*28 images are considered as input to neural network model with 3 layers (Input layer: 784 nodes (28\*28); 1 hidden layer: 100 nodes; output layer: 10 node (represent number from 1 to 10)). I also use backpropagation technique and sigmoid function as activation function for this model
